# Website Navigation Menu Toggle

josuejure.github.io/my-portfolio/

## Overview

This is a simple JavaScript code that toggles a navigation menu on a website when clicking on a menu icon. 

## Functionality

- Selects the menu icon element and the container element using querySelector
- Adds a click event listener to the menu icon 
- When clicked, it toggles the "change" class on the container element

## How it works

- The "change" class applies CSS styling that transforms the navigation menu to toggle open and closed
- Toggling the class on each click shows/hides the menu

## Customization

- Update the querySelector strings to match the class names on elements in your HTML
- Adjust the CSS styles referenced by the "change" class to control menu animations/transitions

## Dependencies

- None, plain JavaScript only

## Use Cases

- Mobile navigation menus that open/close 
- Hiding/showing elements on a page through toggle interactions
