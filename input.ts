I'm learning a lot from the mid-level developer I'm working with. I also volunteer as a software coach at Codebar, a charity supporting aspiring developers. Having to articulate my thoughts has made me a better communicator and has also deepened my understanding of some programming concepts. Have a look at my projects below, and then reach out to me!"
